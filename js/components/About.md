## About

The [Clery Act](http://clerycenter.org/summary-jeanne-clery-act) dictates that
all federally funded universities share information about crimes that occur on
campus. The [crime log](http://www.dpss.umich.edu/crime-log/) for the
University of Michigan leaves some wanting, so this website is an alternative
take on the data. Some of the niceties you'll find here:

- Quick and responsive (data loads faster)
- Maps to pinpoint incidents
- Statistics to draw fun interpretations from

Perhaps most importantly, this is/was a side project to try my hand at modern
web development. I welcome everyone to examine (contribute!?) to the code over
on Github.

The data is generated by downloading the previous day's incidents and
appending it to a running list of incidents, and by offloading the data, the
backend server for the DPS's won't be stressed every serving additional
requests.

I previously created [another site](https://umich.nbsoftsolutions.com) with a
similar purpose only it was architected slightly different (focused mainly
server-side). The old site also gathered data by manually scraping the police
department's site because their JSON API had not been constructed. Rethinking
the site, I decided to focus more on offline capabilities and user experience.
Hopefully, I've succeeded.

Why is this site focused on the University of Michigan? Well, it's my alma mater!
